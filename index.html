                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Corey Miller.  I was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I am 31 years old.  Previously in my career I was in sales for a beverage distributor as a territory manager for the last 6 years.  As I assessed where my career was going, along with my future goals, I came to the conclusion it was time to make a career change.  I researched a lot of different options and fields.  After some time I made the decision that I wanted to get into Web Development.  From there I researched coding bootcamps and found one  being offered in my hometown through the University of Minnesota.  It was the perfect option for me logistically, so I decided to take the dive having no previous experience in the field.  

               </P>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my spare time I like to engulf myself in Minnesota sports; namely the Minnesota Vikings.  The last major professional team in Minnesota to win a championship was the Minnesota Twins, and I was 4 years old at the time.  The last time the Vikings won a Superbowl was, well never.  That will only make the taste of victory that much sweeter when the time comes, and I think they are on the right track.  I am also into health and fitness.  I am very much interested in the evolution of science as it relates to our health.  Hopefully as science continues to evolve we are all able to enjoy this thing called life for a very long time.
